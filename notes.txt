Page 2: tactic schema
#0 Use a canvas to put the SVGs all together (ref Path2D in https://blog.koenvangilst.nl/react-hooks-with-canvas/ )
#1 Create a svg that will be the background for other svg components --> pitch
#2 Position the player svg (a react component) where coordinates are passed as properties
#3 Coordinates of player elements depend on:
 - tactical schema: 1-2-2-1-2-1 for example
 - number of players
#4 Drag and drop vs select player -> select position
 -> choose a player: as a player is selected, the player is marked as selected and the available positions are also "higlighted"
 -> choose a position: name of player appears under position, player icon on the right is marked as non-available
 -> double click on position: remove player

--- Solution to manage the players on the pitch ----
 * visualize: pitch + 9 players at 9 different positions (the positions will be related to the tactical schema)
 * on click on a player, som visual attribute changes to notify the player is selected
 * the player will have a text after a player is chosen on the righ side of the screen

 -> we'll have to generate pitch + players (with attributes) after each change/click
 -> we'll use an array of players where we will apply .map() => return "<circle> or any other complex <svg>"
